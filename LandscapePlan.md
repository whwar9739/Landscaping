# Final Project Plan: Foundation Drainage, Retaining Wall, and Landscape

* **Location:** Sioux Falls, SD
* **Date:** June 9, 2025
* **Primary Goal:** To resolve a negative grade by installing a new drainage system and a 90-foot retaining wall. The definitive design features a **wall with a perfectly level top**, resulting in a variable physical height. Surplus soil will be repurposed to create a backyard sledding hill.

## Section 1: Final Design & Key Specifications

* **Wall Type:** Level-Top, Variable-Height. The foundation will be perfectly level, and the wall height will vary to keep the top of the wall flush with the existing yard.
* **Wall System:** Lowe's `4-in H x 11.6-in L Charcoal Concrete Retaining Wall Block`.
* **Wall Length:** 90 feet.
* **Drainage Type:** Gravity-Fed French Drain. The trench bottom will be sloped in a "V" shape towards a central low point.
* **Sump Line Solution:** The existing buried sump pump line will be crossed by the new French drain using a **Heated Inverted Siphon**.
* **Surplus Soil Solution:** All surplus excavated soil will be used to construct a backyard sledding hill.
* **Topsoil Source:** Existing topsoil from a previous project will be screened and reused for the sledding hill.

## Section 4: Complete Project Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Construction Logistics
1.  **Call 811:** Have all underground utility lines marked. **(DO THIS FIRST)**
2.  **Order & Stage Materials:** Order all bulk materials for delivery. Purchase all other items and have them organized on-site.
3.  **Site Prep:** Clear the work area of all obstacles. Lay down a large tarp for storing existing rock.

### Phase 2: Manual Prep Work ("Sweat Equity")
1.  **Move Existing Rock:** Rake all existing decorative rock onto the storage tarp.
2.  **Expose Sump Line:** Carefully hand-dig to fully expose the section of the existing sump pump pipe where the new drain will cross.
3.  **Mark Layout:** Use stakes, string, and marking paint to lay out the exact location of the new wall and drain trench.

### Phase 3: Rental Day - Excavation & Grading
1.  **Sod Cutting:** Use the rented sod cutter to remove the 82 sq. ft. of grass.
2.  **Mass Excavation:** Use the mini-excavator to perform the main dig. Create the consistent 5% slope away from the house, resulting in a **perfectly level path** for the wall foundation.
3.  **Build Sledding Hill Base:** Move all surplus soil to the designated spot, building the hill up in 1-foot compacted layers.

### Phase 4: Rental Day - Trenching & Compaction
1.  **Dig Trenches:** Use the walk-behind trencher to dig the **sloped** French drain trench inside the level area.
2.  **Compact:** Use the plate compactor on the soil for the sledding hill and on the gravel base for the retaining wall foundation.

### Phase 5: Wall & Drainage Installation
1.  **Install French Drain:** Lay the geotextile fabric, sloped gravel base, perforated pipe, and build the **Heated Inverted Siphon** section.
2.  **Build Retaining Wall:** Install the level base course and build the variable-height wall up to your level string line. Secure courses with adhesive.
3.  **Install Capstones:** Secure the capstones with adhesive.

### Phase 6: Final Landscaping
1.  **Backfill:** Backfill the French drain trench with gravel.
2.  **Install Fabric & Rock:** Lay the main geotextile fabric over the entire bed and spread your reused and new decorative rock.
3.  **Finish Sledding Hill:** Screen and amend your existing topsoil pile. Cover the hill with a 4-inch layer of this processed topsoil, spread the grass seed, and stake down the erosion control blankets. Water thoroughly.
